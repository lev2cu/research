DETAILS:

This code is in an experimental stage. It provides several classes capable of
providing real-time visual odometry for a hand-held RGB-D camera, and a map
server which accumulates an octree-based map.

Currently under development:
 
 - loop-closing
 - odometric / IMU input

INSTALLING:

  rosmake ccny_vison_rgbd --rosdep-install

LAUNCH FILES:

1. ccny_rgbd/launch/sparse_mapping.launch:

  Launches a sparse tracker, and the mapper. Mapper publishes accumulated 
  map periodically.

2. ccny_rgbd/launch/sparse_dense_kd_mapping.launch:

  Launches a sparse tracker with firther refining by dense kd-tree GICP, 
  and the mapper. Mapper publishes accumulated map periodically.

3. ccny_rgbd/launch/sparse_dense_octree_mapping.launch:

  Launches a sparse tracker with firther refining by dense octree GICP, 
  and the mapper. Mapper publishes accumulated map periodically.

CAMERA SETTINGS:

 * depth registration: on
 * resolution: QVGA @ 30Hz (recommended) or VGA @ 30Hz

REQUIRED TOPICS:

 * /camera/depth_registered/points

REQUIRED TF'S:

 * base_link -> camera frame (assumed static)
